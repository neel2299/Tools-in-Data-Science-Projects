But as I said earlier, in order get into the details of ARIMA, Lags, Autocorrelation plot we need to dive deep into time-series modelling. Our assumption is you will learn time-series modelling from other courses and this course teaches you how to apply time-series modelling in python. We need to come up with 3x times of content if we have to dive deep into every algorithm/technique we use in the tools which would be bit too much and is not the scope of this course.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, welcome all your questions if you want to learn. Please do post in discourse. To answer your question -</p>\n<p>Autocorrelation plot is used to check how much a value is correlated with respect to its past. Meaning - if you consider stock price data (let’s say IRCTC stock). Let’s say you have 365 day closing price of IRCTC stock in a single column in excel. Now if you create another column ‘lag 1’ where you have 1day lagged price of IRCTC stock. Meaning - for day 2, you have day 1 price, for day 3, you hav day 2 price.</p>\n<p>Visually it might seem like this -</p>\n<p>IRCTC.    IRCTC_Lag1.    IRCTC_Lag2<br>\n800.         NA                     NA<br>\n812          800                    NA<br>\n811          812                    800<br>\n828          811                    812<br>\n…</p>\n<p>From the above table you could see lag 1 is previous day value, lag 2 is 2 days before value for every closing price. The first row for lag 1 is NA because there is no previous day value as that is the starting day, and first 2 rows are NA for lag 2 price as there is no 2 previous days values. So we remove those 2 rows from analysis.</p>\n<p>Among the remaining values, if you take correlation (irctc, irctc_lag1), correlation (irctc, irctc_lag2) values, these are called autocorrelation values. Basically autocorrelation is correlation of a column with respect to its own past. So we can see autocorrelation for 1,2,3,4,5…n day lags.</p>\n<p>Autocorrelation plot visualizes the correlation of present values with respect to its different lag values and thats why it starts from 1 (because correlation of present value with lag 0 is 1, as they are same).</p>\n<p>We use this plot to understand which of the lags are significant (lies above the shaded region in the graph) so that we can use those lags as features in our forecasting model or use those lags as moving averages in arima - meaning, if 5 day lag is significant, I can use 5 day moving average in arima.</p>","post_number":5,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2022-01-21T06:55:49.981Z","reply_count":2,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":29,"readers_count":28,"score":95.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":29295,"topic_slug":"auto-correlation-plot","display_username":"Mahesh Balan U","primary_group_name":"course_support","flair_name":"course_support","flair_url":"balance-scale","flair_bg_color":"0040ff","flair_color":"1affc6","version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"user_title":"Course_Team","title_is_group":true,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":5,"can_act":true},{"id":3,"can_act":true},{"id":4,"can_act":true},{"id":8,"can_act":true},{"id":7,"can_act":true}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":6139,"hidden":false,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"excerpt":"Hi Anand, \nThank you for voicing out.
